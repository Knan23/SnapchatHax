# Note

While I am no longer actively developing this project, others have stepped in to fix it along the way. I have heard that it works as of January 6, 2015.

# Purpose

Quick, we don't want them to know that we saved this pic, what shall we do? SnapchatHax to the rescue! The purpose of this project is twofold:

* to provide an easy-to-use Objective-C platform to interface with the Snapchat backend.
* to provide users with an easy-to-use iOS application for the purpose of bypassing Snapchat's inherent limitations.

Currently, this bare-bones app does my minimal requirements. Now, however, I have my heart set on beating the guy who wrote [SnapHack](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/snaphack-pro-for-snapchat/id716560946?mt=8&ign-mpt=uo%3D4). By the end of this, I should have a relatively full-featured Objective-C interface for Snapchat's backend!


# To-do

Here's a list of things I think are pretty much essential:

* Make the backlog include old snaps that are no longer viewable
* Option to clear feed
* Change nickname and email address

Here are some features which would ideally be added:

* Send snaps to friends (pictures & video)
* Add & remove friends
* Block and unblock users
* Do *something* with stories, although I don't even understand them.
* Get "bests" of users

Update: I have since started using [dstelljes/php-snapchat/](https://github.com/dstelljes/php-snapchat/) for reference. This is a more complete set of functions.
